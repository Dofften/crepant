I am a Software Developer with great interest in AI/ML.
I built my first model in 2021 - a simple footballer performance prediction
model - that solved one of the simplest problems for me but sent me into an AI frenzy
of all the possibilities and potential impact of AI.
I like writing code to solve problems in a cool way.
